# AirSim Collective Algorithm Testing
This repository is a fork from Microsoft's AirSim platform. It is currently being optimized for obstacle avoidance training models for drones and vehicles, as well as experimentation with Capsule Convolutional Neural Networks (CCNN). The end of goal of this project is to develop a platform to easily test swarm-based, collective sampling state estimation networks and communications patterns.

## Objectives
1. Design a easy-to-use testing harness for verification of state-estimation, collective agent networks.
2. Design, test and implement a software-in-the-loop training process for obstacle avoidance models based upon image and distance data (stereo cameras and lidar/radar data)
3. Research Capsule Convultional Neural Networks for use in obstacle avoidance and adverserial agent detection.
4. Design and implement a distributed, Deep reinforcement learning platform for drones utilizing either Microsoft Azure or AWS for training of complex control modueles and SLAM components.

### Gathering training data

There are two ways you can generate training data from AirSim for deep learning. The easiest way is to simply press the record button in the lower right corner. This will start writing pose and images for each frame. The data logging code is pretty simple and you can modify it to your heart's content.

A better way to generate training data exactly the way you want is by accessing the APIs. This allows you to be in full control of how, what, where and when you want to log data.

### Computer Vision mode

Yet another way to use AirSim is the so-called "Computer Vision" mode. In this mode, you don't have vehicles or physics. You can use the keyboard to move around the scene, or use APIs to position available cameras in any arbitrary pose, and collect images such as depth, disparity, surface normals or object segmentation.

### Weather Effects

Press F10 to see various options available for weather effects. You can also control the weather using [APIs](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/apis#weather-apis). Press F1 to see other options available.
